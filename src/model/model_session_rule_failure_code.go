// SessionRuleFailureCode - Possible values are - NF_MAL: Indicates that the PCC rule could not be successfully installed (for those provisioned from the PCF) or activated (for those pre-defined in SMF) or enforced (for those already successfully installed) due to SMF/UPF malfunction. - RES_LIM: Indicates that the PCC rule could not be successfully installed (for those provisioned from PCF) or activated (for those pre-defined in SMF) or enforced (for those already successfully installed) due to a limitation of resources at the SMF/UPF. - SESSION_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_FAILURE: Indicates the session rule could not be successfully enforced due to failure during the allocation of resources for the PDU session in the UE, RAN or AMF. - UNSUCC_QOS_VAL: indicates that the QoS validation has failed. - INCORRECT_UM: The usage monitoring data of the enforced session rule is not the same for all the provisioned session rule(s). - UE_STA_SUSP: Indicates that the UE is in suspend state. - UNKNOWN_REF_ID: Indicates that the session rule could not be successfully installed/modified because the referenced identifier to a Policy Decision Data or to a Condition Data is unknown to the SMF. - INCORRECT_COND_DATA: Indicates that the session rule could not be successfully installed/modified because the referenced Condition data are incorrect. - REF_ID_COLLISION: Indicates that the session rule could not be successfully installed/modified because the same Policy Decision is referenced by a PCC rule (e.g. the session rule and the PCC rule refer to the same Usage Monitoring decision data). - AN_GW_FAILED: Indicates that the AN-Gateway has failed and that the PCF should refrain from sending policy decisions to the SMF until it is informed that the S-GW has been recovered. This value shall not be used if the SM Policy association modification procedure is initiated for session rule removal only.
